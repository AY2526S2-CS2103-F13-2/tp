**TripLog** is a streamlined, text-based travel management tool designed for frequent travelers who live in the command line.

* **Fast and Distraction-Free:** Designed for power users like software developers who want to log destinations, activities, and personal experiences without leaving their terminal.
* **Organized Logging:** Quickly tag entries as `work` or `personal`, jot down notes on local gems (like that hidden cafe in Berlin), and sort logs by location, date, or activity.
* **Privacy Focused:** Keeps your travel history and sensitive itineraries stored locally, ensuring your data is private and accessible even when you're offline in a train or plane.
* **Precision Planning:** Built-in checks to prevent accidental double-booking of flights or accommodations.

### Why TripLog?
For many "jetsetting" developers, switching to a heavy GUI or a multi-tab spreadsheet to record a favorite restaurant interrupts the workflow. TripLog provides a single source of truth that is keyboard-centric and context-switch free.

### Documentation
